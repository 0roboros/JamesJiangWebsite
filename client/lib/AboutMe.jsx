					<p> My name is James Jiang, a 4th year student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, 
						and Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University. I am very interested in data-driven products, artificial
						intelligence, and virtual reality. </p>
					<p>I am a very curious individual, and need to constantly learn new things. If the challenge or problem is novel or 
					something I haven't seen before, then that's even better. However, merely learning something or understanding it is not enough. 
					Rather, applying the concept in a useful and practical way is a must.
					</p>
					
					<p>I spend a lot of time immersed in my own world, but I also love to exchange ideas in a meaningful manner with those 
					who share similar interests (see "My Fun" page).
					I especially enjoy talking about possibilities, instead of what already exists.
					</p>
					<header>Frequently Asked Questions</header>
					<p> Why are you studying both Computer Science and Business Administration? </p>
					<p> This is the most common soft question I get asked during interviews, and I think the answer defines me very well - 
					I like seeing the big picture. Although I consider myself a detail oriented engineer at heart, I believe a business 
					background will give me a more holistic view of whatever I work on - 
					whether it's understanding customer needs, interpreting decision from higher ups, or communicating with team members. </p>
					<p> What is your biggest weakness? </p>
					<p> My biggest weakness is disengaging. Whenever I set a goal, I find it very hard to disengage until I've accomplished
					what I've set out to do. Often, this means I begin to sacrifice my health or other parts of my life. I have been trying
					(very hard) to get better at this. </p>
					<p> What does success mean to you? </p>
					<p> Success to me is exploration and results, while achieving growth. Exploring a novel idea, experimenting with how to get the optimal result,
					and growing from the experience would be the ideal way to live my life. It may sound a bit idealistic, and I understand that
					it is often very hard to have all three at the same time.</p>
